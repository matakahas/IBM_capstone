# Capstone project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate 

**[Capstone project notebook](./Capstone_Project.ipynb)**

This is a repository of the capstone project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program ([link](https://www.credly.com/badges/03150900-c80c-4546-aba0-056d928368ca?source=linked_in_profile) to certificate).
This program consisted of 9 courses covering various topics in data science tools, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. For the capstone project, I developed a neighborhood recommendation system in the city of Seattle.
Completing the project required me to do the following:

* Curating a dataset with the necessary information (neighborhood longitude and latitude, average rent, etc.)
* Displaying different neighborhoods on an interactive map (with `folium` library)
* Combining the neighborhood dataset with a Foursquare dataset of various nearby businesses
* Clustering neighborhoods with k-means clustering
* Adding additional variables that play a role in deciding a neighborhood to visit/live in
* Creating a recommendation system GUI
